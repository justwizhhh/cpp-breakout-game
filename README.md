# C++ Breakout Game (ARCHIVE)

A clone of the arcade game 'Breakout', with simple bouncing ball physics, and brick collision detection depending on the side getting hit.

Made in ~1 month for a university assignment submission, as part of the "Games in C++' module at UWE Bristol (BSc Games Technology).
